## Introduction

React is complex.
To test a component you need to call it which can interfere with the look of your app.
Also it's made by facebook and they might be reading all of your code.
And to commuincate with the server you need to use the unrelible xmlhttprequest().
WebSlate solves that.
To communicate with the server use the server() object.
No more mixing the javascript with jsx.
Just put it in files and use data providers.
For the server, use server workers.



## Usage
Well don't use it yet.
It's still a work in progress.
Use the soon to be released generator.
For now just follow the project.
